‘NFT-IT’ Proof of Concept is a Multi-chain NFT wallet that allows both Artists and Collectors to use their smart phone camera to view physical artwork NFT’s, get the price from the store it is sold on, and seamlessly swap their ERC721 Non Fungible Tokens (NFT’s) to any blockchain network where they can buy and sell them.

The main feature is a user friendly Augmented Reality interface that displays a link to the NFT’s store for example, Opensea.io, along with the price from the store. 

With NFT-IT anyone can sign in using their ETH wallet to swap their ERC721 NFT’s to any blockchain network ( Proof of concept includes Waves, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon/Matic) 


Walkthrough:

Sign in using ETH wallet (Metamask, Create Wallet, or Import Wallet),

Point camera at artwork,

If ETH wallet is the owner of the NFT in view of the camera, they can chose to swap their NFT to desired network by tapping the send button (current proof of concept : Waves, BSC, or Polygon) and input their respective wallet to receive their ERC721 NFT on any other blockchain network. In the future this will work backwards compatible from Waves, BSC or Polygon back to ETH ERC721.

If ETH wallet is not the owner, the user can view the seller’s price of the NFT superimposed onto the artwork in Augmented Reality and visit the owner’s store. (Proof of concept: Opensea.io) If the user decides to purchase the NFT from the owner’s store, they can then use the same ETH wallet used for login to receive their ERC721 and have the option to receive the NFT on any other blockchain network.

In a future release of NFT-IT we would like to integrate a decentralized bridge like gravity.tech which is a blockchain-agnostic oracle system that supports communication of blockchains with the outside world, cross-chain communication, and sidechains within a single unified structure, and add the ability for a one stop shop where collectors can instantly buy/sell an NFT from an Automated Market Maker that pools liquidity from multiple chains where the NFT is traded.
